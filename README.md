# CS-125-Final-Project-Word-Search-Solver
An Android app that my friend and I created using the Tesseract OCR Engine API. 

The user takes a picture of a word search and the corresponding word bank. The app extracts the text using OCR, solves the word search, and displays the results on the user's phone with the found words highlighted.
